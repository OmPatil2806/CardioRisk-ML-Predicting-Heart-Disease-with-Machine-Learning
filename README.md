**🫀 Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning**

**📖 Project Overview:-** This project, CardioRisk ML, is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict an individual's risk of developing heart disease. By leveraging clinical and demographic data, the model assists healthcare providers in the early identification of high-risk patients, enabling proactive interventions, optimized resource allocation, and improved patient outcomes. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow: from data exploration and preprocessing, through feature engineering and model training, to evaluation and interpretation.

**🎯 Business & Clinical Problem:-**Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. A major challenge for healthcare organizations is the early identification of at-risk individuals amidst large volumes of patient data and limited resources. Failure to identify these patients leads to higher healthcare costs and poorer patient outcomes.
This project addresses this critical need by providing a data-driven tool that can analyze patient records and predict the likelihood of heart disease, allowing for:

1. Prioritization of preventative therapy.
2. Efficient allocation of medical resources.
3. Reduction of unnecessary testing.
4. Ultimately, saving lives through early intervention.

**📊 Dataset**

Dataset: [Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

Description: The dataset contains clinical and demographic information from 1,025 patients, with 14 attributes used to predict the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease (target variable).

**🛠️ Project Pipeline & Technical Implementation**

1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
2. Class Imbalance Handling
3. Data Visualization
4. Machine Learning Models

**📈 Key Results & Insights**

1. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% and an AUC-ROC score of Y.
2. Key risk factors identified by the model include: [List top features, e.g., chest pain type, maximum heart rate, etc.].
3. The model demonstrates strong potential as a screening tool for clinicians.
